In this challeng, I managed to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json. Also I created:
- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- A bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Also displayed the sample's metadata and updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
